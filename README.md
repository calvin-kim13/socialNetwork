## Description

This backend application utilizes MongoDB as a database and mongoose to create api requests. There is no front end to this application which means a third party application such as Postman or Insomnia will be needed to view the api requests. The main topic covered with this application is the ability to perform CRUD operations with a NoSQL database.
